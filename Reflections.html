      The task looked straight forward and required little direction to set up the group project dynamics. The team met up with one another as complete strangers and have found many ways to collaborate to get the end goal within communication. The team was open for suggestions and helped one another out to ensure we met the guidelines set out in the assignment PDF. The one thing that was slightly overwhelming was that we were required to get a plan of action and this wasn't always the most forward thinking plan at first. It wasn't until we got halfway that we were able to engage the tasks and move forward at a pace.
      <br><br>
       I found the dynamics to be effective and the leadership shown by Elijah was motivating to get the meeting on a roll and start the tasks. Mark was awesome at his brainstorming skills,Rukshana was progressive at setting up the GitHub repository and added her involvement into all  the tasks. Susan was very on point with her tasks as well as the group task and her written work was very well structured. Every member was great to work with and the team had many different walks of life rolled into one making it a fun experience that would recommend this team a 5/5 stars great team!

        This team as a whole worked together quite well as the communication between the five of us was absolutely brilliant. None of us were scared to ask a question or communicate something we were thinking and we were most often on the same page with everything. There were very minimal problems to solve and any that did arise was something that could be solved within a few minutes at most.
  The start of the group meetings was slow, all of us trying to find our feet within the group and seeing who would be the lead. This meant that we got slightly behind in our assignment and weren’t entirely sure what we were supposed to be doing. In saying that, as soon as we figured out the tasks at hand and started our shared google document everything went into full swing. We created a Facebook group chat, had our meetings all planned out (every Monday and Thursday at 6.00pm Melbourne time) and our repository was created.
<br><br>
  Each person dedicated an amazing amount of effort and commitment to this group and this assignment and it is shown in the work we have submitted.
  The webpage Ashton set up and did almost all of the planning for, he took great care in the programming of the HTML and as such has been able to showcase our ideas in an interesting manner.
  Rukshana created our GitHub Repository and set it all up for us to use, she explained to us where she was faltering and allowed us all to help her and as a team we were able to talk her through things to do with GitHub which allowed us to strength in the group.
  Mark had a great hand in the Project Idea and setting up how that would look and what areas needed to be completed when, within the meetings he displayed great leadership and was able to direct the conversation to the areas of the assignment that needed to be addressed.
  Susan was brilliant in her knowledge and contribution, when discussing tasks and what areas each person needed to do she was more than willing to take on whatever part was necessary and as such created a safe space where everyone was comfortable with the tasks.

        I had fun doing this group assignment. Everyone was proactive, friendly, helpful and cheerful. From the very first day I liked that everyone was on the same page, and we helped each other with the assignment. I believe our work coordination went really well. If one initiated setting up MS-Teams while creating and setting up documents in google docs and other set up GitHub page and so on. Each individual was initiated to take over their tasks and informed the team what they were working on so others could work on other tasks. The other thing is I had this issue with the website which I was not able to figure out myself on what went wrong. But we all worked together on this one session and fixed it up for which I am very thankful for. Everything went perfectly so I don't think there is anything that could be improved except for the fact that there was a time limit. From this group project, I learnt the importance of an individual contribution towards teamwork. It helped us complete the assignment smoothly. And everyone was very understanding of each other’s situation. GitHub was set up amazingly by Ashton and I loved how it looked on the website.
