      The task looked straight forward and required little direction to set up the group project dynamics. The team met up with one another as complete strangers and have found many ways to collaborate to get the end goal within communication. The team was open for suggestions and helped one another out to ensure we met the guidelines set out in the assignment PDF. The one thing that was slightly overwhelming was that we were required to get a plan of action and this wasn't always the most forward thinking plan at first. It wasn't until we got halfway that we were able to engage the tasks and move forward at a pace.

       I found the dynamics to be effective and the leadership shown by Elijah was motivating to get the meeting on a roll and start the tasks. Mark was awesome at his brainstorming skills,Rukshana was progressive at setting up the GitHub repository and added her involvement into all  the tasks. Susan was very on point with her tasks as well as the group task and her written work was very well structured. Every member was great to work with and the team had many different walks of life rolled into one making it a fun experience that would recommend this team a 5/5 stars great team!

        I had fun doing this group assignment. Everyone was proactive, friendly, helpful and cheerful. From the very first day I liked that everyone was on the same page, and we helped each other with the assignment. I believe our work coordination went really well. If one initiated setting up MS-Teams while creating and setting up documents in google docs and other set up GitHub page and so on. Each individual was initiated to take over their tasks and informed the team what they were working on so others could work on other tasks. The other thing is I had this issue with the website which I was not able to figure out myself on what went wrong. But we all worked together on this one session and fixed it up for which I am very thankful for. Everything went perfectly so I don't think there is anything that could be improved except for the fact that there was a time limit. From this group project, I learnt the importance of an individual contribution towards teamwork. It helped us complete the assignment smoothly. And everyone was very understanding of each otherâ€™s situation. GitHub was set up amazingly by Ashton and I loved how it looked on the website.
