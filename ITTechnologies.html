    <br>

      <div class="section06Div01">
        <h class="boxTextTitle">What does it do?</h>
        <p class="boxTextLeft">
       Cybersecurity is defined as the practise of protecting a system or program from forms of digital threats. This can be done preemptively to avoid an attack or to mitigate the threat. It is not uncommon for cybersecurity mitigation to be done actively when a threat has already caused malicious damage to a system that may have or may not have a security plan implemented prior to the attack.
       <br><br>
        The major issue with cybersecurity is that the experts are constantly trying to outsmart the adversaries, and this has led to newer technologies and practise to evolve to defeat many new tricks used by the attackers. Encryption methods are always a target for these attacks and one example is that of SHA or Secure Hash Algorithms this technology has become increasingly more complex as computing has evolved the battle for encryption is that we comprise speed for security but with the rise of faster systems this maybe less of an issue in the future.
       <br><br>
       The latest state of the art practise in cybersecurity are in the field of Deep learning. Deep learning is a sub field of machine learning where machine AI code is left to self-maintain its code and to change or create new code as it continues to learn from segments of behaviour linked to the AI machine. Deep learning can be seen as a neural network of information used to link one segment to another.
       <br><br>
       Cybersecurity experts are looking into the way we can harvest the ability of deep learning to check on behaviours that may or may not be that of a malicious attack or simply a harmless process. Deep learning may be the key to determine if an attack is trying to jeopardise the integrity of the system by detecting behaviours that are out-side the deep learnings recognised permissions or access to certain areas of its base AI machine. With the rise of technology there are always going to be “gremlins” in the machine and the issue that may cause the most harm may be that the deep learning might not be able to forward plan an attack as the behaviour is simply not known to the deep learning code or not a known behaviour. For example, as a human age they learn new experiences and new behaviours so the deep learning if looked out in the context of say a child may not know how to drive a car or simply what a politician is. This leads to the fact that this could be only one process in the detection of threats as other systems like most Cybersecurity plans require multiple processes to combat looming threats.
       <br><br>
       Deep Learning is increasingly being used and as technology grows exponentially with rapid contributions from other technologies in the next 3-5 years deep learning will be part of some systems. Technologies that contribute to this growth are the use of cloud-based systems for data storage as deep learning requires growth within the way the code expands as the machine learns new behaviours. Another contribution to aid in the rise of deep learning is communication infrastructures for the transfer of data at faster speeds to cloud systems. Take the self-driving car concept. This requires quick decision-making processes that are suggested to be advanced by mobile technology for communication such as 5G allowing for faster data with shorter latency.
       Deep learning, cloud computing and communications work together and as these technologies grow and are made more available to consumers so will the threats to data and information so in turn the need for cybersecurity will be a required area of IT as well as new methods to mitigate threats.

       <br>
       <h class="boxTextTitle">What is the likely impact?</h>
         <div class="section06Div01">
           <p class="boxTextLeft">
             The likely impact of cybersecurity advances will open a new set of ideas for the future of human dependents on automation including the automation of machines and services. Having the machine itself check for issues may ease the process used when setting up a cyber security plan for the systems linked to the machine.  Deep learning could change the way a program functions based on behaviour and tailor an application to the needs of the consumer.
             <br><br>
             The improvements to Mobile computing have also come about rapidly and cybersecurity within this area is becoming a new challenge as threats are more likely to infiltrate more users as most of the global population are using a mobile device one way or another.  Recent spikes in flubot attacks during Covid-19 has prompted cybersecurity to enhance their policies regarding external links and the focus on human education or social engineering being top of the mitigation strategies. Deep learning will take advantage of many services such as help support which can benefit from automation as well as online shopping and the reflection on purchasing behaviours with the consumer.
             <br><br>
             The impact of development might in the future see less involvement in tasks and send the work to deep learning as a way of reducing time and cost with human employees. Redundancy of human workers has seen to be an issue with automation but the fact that cybersecurity is beneficial for the safety of people and data this industry should hold strong in the race to automate the world. What we may see is that the technologies of deep learning are leaning towards the reduction in hard programming and a shift in programming towards machine learning. The security base of AI is especially important when we talk about the medical side of AI as well as Banking and finances and cybersecurity is a strong runner for these areas of IT.

        </div>

        <h class="boxTextTitle">How will this affect you?</h>
          <div class="section06Div01">
            <p class="boxTextLeft">
              The rise of Deep learning and cyber security will impact the way of learning, shopping, and general support from online service. This may be a product of automation that will use behaviours to impact the way advertising is shown to what product or companies can bid the highest to get the attention of the consumer. The impact of cybersecurity is that the trust of the service's cyber security policies is implemented correctly and not reliant on the use of deep learning or machine learning to be centre stage. Also, the insurance that private data is not overlooked due to the deep learning not being able to recognise an attack pattern.
              <br><br>
              The daily impact would be little, and it is seen even now that Google Ads have allowed for the norm of the computer using cookies to sell targeted ads. But to oneself a concern is that the target advertising will be shown and if an attack changes the deep learning and the deep learning doesn’t recognise then this can leave oneself vulnerable to the attackers’ intentions. The effect on friends and family would see that the collated data of a household or if not monitored a friend's social media post may be aggregated to be sold to the highest bidder and as seen in today’s society gives power to the major company and rejects the smaller business leading to price setting by major parties.
              <br><br>
              Cybersecurity is essential to the upcoming change in the technological landscape and there is always a target for attackers when we deal in the new gold of the space age being data. Deep learning and cloud computing is not going away and the adaptation to these technologies needs to be embraced but still micromanaged enough to not allow for attacks to have a knock on effect on the people who use these services.

     <br>

       <div class="section06Div01">
         <h class="boxTextTitle">What does it do?</h>
         <p class="boxTextLeft">
           Oxford Languages defines cryptocurrency as “a digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.”
           In better terms, cryptocurrency is a type of digital or online money maintained but not controlled by any one entity. This has many pros and less cons, however, it is not widely accepted as a form of money yet, the vision of cryptocurrencies is that it will become mainstream and used globally online.
           Cryptocurrencies give online users another way of payment through a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is the system that records and stores all the transactions of cryptocurrencies to be able to maintain the system across several different computers.
           The first ever cryptocurrency to be created was Bitcoin, this was created to be a “purely peer-to-peer version” of electronic money. Cryptocurrencies as a whole give power within money back to the users instead of having overall government control over them and Bitcoin was the first to implement this. The value of Bitcoin has been seen to increase over the last five years especially although it was first created back in 2008 and remained the only cryptocurrency until 2011.
           Cryptocurrencies can be described as having three major playing fields while in use. The first is giving the power of the user's money back to them rather than under the thumb of another authority. This means that there is no one that can freeze, access or use the funds without strict permission directly from the user. Generally the overall Government or Banks can access and freeze people’s accounts until a necessary task is completed and gives those authorities all the real power behind the money. Cryptocurrency works better here as it is all in the user’s hands.
           The second is the fastness and simplicity behind the transactions. With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it takes out the ‘middleman’ and no longer has the small part paid to the bank when used.

            The term “Cloud” basically refers to the several servers connected to the internet that are linked together to share the load and can be leased as part of a software or application service. Its improved accessibility, scalability, flexibility, lower costs and less maintenance, make it a popular choice for organisations to move into this service. Instead of using one single powerful machine, complex processes can be distributed across multiple smaller computers to share the load. Organizations use an infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) model to process workloads and store information. They can access virtual server functions remotely through an online interface. A cloud server is a virtual server or a physical server running in a cloud computing environment. It is built, hosted, and delivered via a cloud computing platform via the internet, and can be accessed remotely. It has all the software they require to run and can function as independent units. Cloud services, like web hosting, data hosting and sharing, and software or application use, are infrastructure, platforms, or software maintained by third-party providers and made available to consumers via the internet. It allows user data to flow from front-end clients such as servers, tablets, desktops, laptops, and anything else on the users' end, to the internet, to the provider's systems, and back. It can be accessed using only a computer, operating system, and internet or virtual private network connectivity (VPN).
            <br><br>
            As cloud technologies evolve and more companies move to cloud-based services, there are a number of changes or emerging trends accepted in the coming years but we are only going to discuss two of those trends.
            <br><br>
            1.Serverless Computing: This service removes the need for software developers to continuously manage and maintain network servers and become more productive, focusing on development and helping the front-end teams optimize workflow. This is quite a new cloud offering but its demand is predicted to grow by 25 per cent by 2025.
            <br><br>
            2.Multi-Cloud Strategy: Another change in the cloud is adopting a multi-cloud strategy. It allows businesses to use more than two cloud services from several vendors and avoid vendor lock-in while taking advantage of the best offerings each vendor offers. This means in the future organisations are more likely to develop multi-cloud strategies with little to no dependence on a specific provider. Microsoft and Oracle, rivals in the cloud space, have already made this strategic move, linking their cloud services and allowing customers to run enterprise applications across Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure.
            <br><br>
            One weak point of current cloud computing is that it’s handled by a limited number of providers who dominate the space. These large, centralized data-processing centres tie computing and storage ability to the proximity, bandwidth and resources provided. With 127 new IoT devices connecting to the Internet every second, issues of latency, bandwidth, and security are inevitable. Edge computing is an emerging cloud trend that involves building localized data centres for computation and storage at or near where they are needed. This offsets the load on the cloud and improves the deployment and running of a wide array of applications. 2020 has been a pivotal year for the cloud as it played a lead role in facilitating remote work solutions. It allowed organizations to fuse existing organizational processes with novel cloud technologies to allow for greater flexibility during these uncertain times. COVID-19 has facilitated a focus on cloud capabilities as companies compete to thrive in this new remote work environment. The cloud has become an essential part of continuing business and is the key to unlocking organizational growth. Artificial intelligence is becoming more relevant in the workplace to streamline business processes with activities such as payroll automation, budget forecasting, and compliance and eliminate manual tasks. AI is expected to continue to grow with the market exceeding $300 billion by 2024. Technologies like AI and robotics require greater speed and processing power and edge computing is the answer to capitalizing on these advancements and shaping them in the years ahead. With these advancements in technologies, cybersecurity plays an equally important role to protect sensitive data in the air.

         <br>
         <h class="boxTextTitle">What is the likely impact?</h>
           <div class="section06Div01">
             <p class="boxTextLeft">
            Servers have been an essential part of the computing architecture but with the development of cloud computing, moving to serverless infrastructure has been inevitable. While serverless architectures offer greater scalability, more flexibility, and quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost, there are some disadvantages like testing, debugging and some security concerns. As developers do not have visibility into backend processes, debugging can become more complicated as well as testing. And it may not be possible to fully secure personal and sensitive data.
            <br><br>
            Likewise having multiple clouds in an organisation can lower costs, increase flexibility and improve overall performance by strategizing based upon the requirements and demands of a company. But as most cloud engineers are moving towards specialising one major cloud rather than several cloud providers to differentiate themselves. So, these multiple clouds may require organisations to seek individuals with deep technical and specialist talent in a single cloud to maximise efficiency and engineering depth.
            <br><br>
            Nonetheless, if a company is choosing cloud services, there will likely be organisational changes. When cloud is adopted, some of the people who previously looked after those jobs might actually get disrupted on those workflows and ultimately either be job change or job loss. In a study by the Centre for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, 85 percent of 5.6 million jobs in the US from 2000-2010 were lost due to technological change and the majority of them were from automation. This job loss will more likely be across many other industries as robots, cloud services, and other forms of automation will do the work instead of the human resources. For instance, drones or self-driving vehicles will cut down delivery, taxi or any driving jobs and machine learning and AI systems will reduce many white-collar jobs like accountants, financial planners and so on.

              <p class="boxTextLeft">
                It is so amazing when you come to realise how much cloud services have impacted our daily lives without even knowing. Cloud computing has such a significant role in our everyday activities be it iCloud storage or OneDrive or Dropbox to store our files or your Facebook post or Instagram feed. We have been using the cloud services without even realising that we have been using it.
                <br><br>
                After the pandemic we have all been advised to stay-at-home orders by the government at one time or the other to avoid the spread of Coronavirus, which made us students to study from the comfort of our home. And cloud computing has enabled us to access data anywhere and at any time. We can enrol online, participate in online learning activities and access study materials, journals, articles and many more. And it has allowed educational institutions to use the storage cloud to store huge amounts of data securely without complicated or expensive infrastructure. When we are using Netflix to watch our favourite movies, we are using the cloud. Also, it has enabled businesses to access sophisticated analysis that gives detailed insights on customers and potential services. In the hospitals or clinics or medical centres, the use of cloud helps manage and share patient data to reduce operational costs and also if we want to access our medical records we can do so in our mobiles.
                <br><br>
                Online shopping platforms, pre pre-installed navigation programs are also other areas where this cloud services have affected. Thanks to social media and the cloud computing, we are able to stay connected with our families and friends in this pandemic and with those who are staying far away from us.
