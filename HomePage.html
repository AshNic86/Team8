    <p class="boxText">I was born in Melbourne, Victoria and grew up there until I was 17 years old where I moved out of home to Cairns, Queensland. I have a vast variety of hobbies that I occupy my time with, this includes creative writing, reading, basketball, gaming and building computers. I have always had a knack for technology and the older I got the more I found myself relying on each piece I had. As well as my love for technology I have always felt the drive to find out exactly how things work, this included opening up computers to see how they run and teaching myself as much as I can with my limited time about each part and how to make them better. This then turned into wanting to know how apps are created, and then websites and it grew from there.

I am very excited about my path to become a teacher.I like to go out and spend time with a close group of friends to hike in a quiet, serene place. AndI love spending time with my daughter.

    <p class="boxText">Currently studying for a Bachelor of IT at RMIT and also playing football professionally representing the U20 Matildas Team.
      Rasamee is a hard working person who is willing to learn and take on many challenges. I was born in Thailand and moved to Western Sydney when I was 12.
      Being in Australia has allowed me to do many things that I love, such as playing football, while I was able to study at a great school.
      Other than practicing football and going to the gym, I also like spending time at the beach, hiking and exploring places around Sydney.
      CNC machining was something I really liked when I was working as a Boilermaker and other than figuring problems with tech, I am quite new to IT.
